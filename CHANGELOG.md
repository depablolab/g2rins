# Changelog

Notable, user-visible changes to G²RINS. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions correspond to the repository's `v*` git tags.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CITATION.cff`, this changelog, issue forms, and a pull request template.
- GitHub Release automation for future `v*` tags: build, verify, attach wheel/sdist, and generate release notes.

### Changed

- Pull requests now run a faster Linux-only Python 3.10/3.14 test matrix, while the full Linux/Windows/macOS compatibility matrix runs after merges to `main` and on the monthly schedule. Python 3.14 replaces 3.13 as the highest version tested in CI (RDKit ≥ 2026.3 publishes Python 3.14 wheels).
- Updated official GitHub Actions to current stable majors and tightened workflow permissions.
- Packaging and installation workflows fetch full Git history and tags so `setuptools-scm` can derive versions reliably.
- Simplified the `setuptools-scm` configuration in `pyproject.toml` while preserving `g2rins.__version__`.

### Fixed

- CI explicitly installs the `[test]` extra so pytest is available in test jobs (#1).
- Removed a machine-local `.trunk/plugins/trunk` artifact from version control.
